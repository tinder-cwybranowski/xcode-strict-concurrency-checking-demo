# Demo Repository Template

This project is a template for demonstrating / reproducing issues found in other external dependencies, so that high quality GitHub Issues can be submitted to repository owners. After bootstrapping with this template, adjust the contents (e.g. README, source files, etc.) as necessary to encapsulate the specific demonstration.

Examples include:
- [tinder-cwybranowski/xcode-runtime-sanitizer-demo](https://github.com/tinder-cwybranowski/xcode-runtime-sanitizer-demo)
    - [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/rules_xcodeproj/issues/1613)

This project was created to add context and reproduction steps to the [GitHub Issue opened here](TODO).
